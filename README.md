# Godot Terrain Module
Custom Godot Engine Build with Terrain Module
## Description
Over the last year I have worked in this project. My idea was to create a Terrain system inside godot that worked under both backends GLES3 - GLES2.
### What you get:
* Full In Editor terrain editor
* Endless Patched terrain
* Complex Biomes Rendering
* AND THE BEST: It works under GLES2 the same way as it does under GLES3 so you can target low end devices ( that was my most important objective all the time )
* More to come ...

### Where are the export templates?
I am releasing the editor for free. The export templates will be available for purchase at a reasonable price soon or if you want to compile the module your self, you can purchase the source code too. 

### Where are the Tutorials?
Tutorials will be available soon. I am working on them.

### Where can I report Issues?
Use this Page. 

# Important!
I am releasing the editor sooner so you can enjoy, or test, I still have some utilities to add and methods to expose to gdscript. Also, you should notice that terrain rendering is not a cheap task, so, target your low end devices wisely.
